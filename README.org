* luftdaten-report
visualize data collected by [[https://luftdaten.info/][luftdaten.info]], combined with official measurement points. Grouped by month and grouped sensors.
Here we make comparable the sensors (official- and project) of sensors in Hannover (h), Braunschweig (bs), and Lehrte (l).

** requirements
 - [[https://luftdaten.info/][luftdaten.info]]: project, found in Stuttgart
 - bash, curl: loop through sensors to download
 - gnuplot: create images with timeline and sensor measurement-results
 - composite (imagemagick): combine multiple images by sensor and legend
 - latex: create browseable pdf with informations about the project
** example out
multiple sensors with separate colors for temperature, humidity, pm10, pm2.5

* usage
configure and run script:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
run.bsh
#+END_SRC

* how it is meant to work
 - in head we list sensors we want to group (show together by month).
 - for each sensor and date we download the file from [[https://archive.luftdaten.info][archive.luftdaten.info]], e.g. '.raw/2017-09-01_dht22_sensor_5394.csv'
 - we merge all files of a sensor to one file by sensor, e.g. '.rawBySensor/5394.csv'
 - for each month and sensor (combining pm10, pm2.5, temperature, humidity), calling 'createPlotfile.bsh' helps create a templatefile for gnuplot, e.g. 'plot/2017-09-5394.plot'
 - for each month and sensor (combining pm10, pm2.5, temperature, humidity), calling gnuplot we create a picture, e.g. 'png/2017-09-5394.png'
 - we combine each picture in sensorgroups and month together, e.g. 'png/2017-09-l.png'
** postpimp pictures
 - after (optional) manuel tuning of pictures, e.g. set highlights by weekend
 - latex/beamer.tex (manually startet) combines pictures to a pdf
